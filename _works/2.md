In his first collection for Emilio Pucci, Creative Director Massimo Giorgetti begins his story with a blank canvas. Florence is the setting for his Pilot Episode which, as with a TV series, hints at the episodes to follow.

He opens the doors of the Palazzo: the iconic rooftop is now linked to the street. The mood is energetic, the speed accelerated, the result precise.

Another beginning, right where it all started, with a new spirit and a founding perspective: timelessly modern, inclusively ageless and immediate.

Florence as a value. Respect for the past as the essence of progress, no nostalgia attached. A palpable Italian flair. Unexpected ease, a boost of immediate energy.

Archive prints bring another Emilio to the fore: the painterly composer. New motifs add a dash of comic strip pop art irony, as with the print “Turisti Fiorentini”, which is also interpreted in embroideries.

The new logo is a rhythmic pattern, intertwined with the Florentine lily.
